    <h2>Why Choose Front-End Developer?</h2>
    <p>
        In today's world, internet takes a extremely important role in our lives. There are so many creative and smart
        companies trying to make use of internet in order to attract customers' attention. During this process, website
        is the thing that makes people pay attention. I am excited about being a front-end developer because I was surprised
        about how front-end contributes to the accomplishment of a wonderful website. There are so many excellent tools
        like JQuery, Bootstrap, and AngularJS. Other than those, there are also many useful frameworks such as Ruby on
        Rails, Django and Laravel. We can even use front-end technologies to build hybrid mobile apps like AngularJS and
        ionic io. These powerful tools and technologies attracts me so much. I can not wait to be a part of front-end
        development team!

    <h2>How Did I build This Site? And Why?</h2>
    <p>
        I build this site by HTML-CSS-JavaScript techniques. Actually my first idea was to use Ruby on Rails Framework.
        However, it seemed like the page was static and there was no need to use Database. So I chose a simple way which
        was to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
